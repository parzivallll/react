            <h1>GAME MODE â€” Find out how good of a pianist you are</h1>
            <p>Recursive Arts Piano Game is an excellent tool to improve your piano playing skills by assessing how 
                accurate you are when playing a particular piece. If GAME MODE is enabled (B), the player's SCORE is
                 displayed above the keyboard (C) so points can be earned or lost depending on how good
                 your timing is when pressing the indicated keys. Just try to be precise: not too late, not too early!</p>
